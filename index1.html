						<br>
	           <p>First and foremost: the following article is a trivial matter and is a snap. Thank you, happy reading.

              For an actor, whether apprentice or confirmed, the casting is an essential and recurring place in his career and professional daily life.
              Young or not so young, we quickly come to go to castings as we go for a coffee at the bar. It is a habit, a necessity, it can even become a drug or a simple meeting place.
              
              And then we know it well, a casting, it does not always succeed.
              Rather, the reverse is the rule. We must therefore show patience, conviction, even courage. A lot has to be done. Several every day. As much as we can. Until our legs, the first ones, cry out.
              
              That's good, castings, that's not what is missing.
              In Paris, it's very simple, some days the buildings are full of them. At any time of the day and night the lights come on, the flashes crackle, the old oak floors creak under the footsteps of artists, actors, models, leading roles and supporting knives for whom the rent is not waiting, any opportunity is belly up, every bet is a necessity, every attempt, even desperate, is worth taking.
              
              But as necessary and unavoidable as it is, the cast nonetheless has its laws, its codes, its rites. Like a parallel world, a forgotten continent, a distant planet, it demands in-depth knowledge and total respect, the obligation to follow its marked paths, its rituals and not to leave its winding roads stuffed with ruts.
              
              Only here, like any language, the cast must be learned, practiced, until it becomes a second skin. And if, for the old backpackers who cross there, it is a routine, almost an instinct, the young wolves who venture there, must keep in mind that if one can be offered there the beginning of you can also bury a future early in a career.
              
              So, for those of you who have not yet made casting their daily gloom, for those who have not yet cut their days in the metro, casting, sleeping, here is a small anthology of phrases to never say in front of a casting director.
              
              These murderous sentences, which immediately send you into the abyss, especially when, at 7:27 p.m., the person in front of you sees in you the thirty-third Indiana Jones or the twenty-seventh Am√©lie Poulain of the day and whose exhausted eardrums will not forgive no longer to anyone for hitting them once too many, anyway, until the next day's casting.
              
              So, during a casting, never say ...</p><br>
            <font bold color=red><h2>Do you like it!?</h2></font>
						<br>
            <p>1 / I DON'T KNOW YOU, BUT I, CASTING, I COULD DO THAT!
              Great ! You are a good customer. Always with a smile on your face, you go through the scenes with ease, you go out after shaking hands with everyone as when you arrived. Is. But I remind you that the goal is not to make a career in casting.
              
              2 / WILL FALLOIR SHIFT A LITTLE, THE FIRST WEEK OF SHOOTING, I AM IN COURCHEVEL.
              If you really can't move your holidays to Courchevel, admit that, as a babysitter, you are in the luggage of this super bankable actress who has just had a baby and who is going to star in the film for which you pass a casting ...</p>
						<br>
            <font bold color=red><h2>More!?</h2></font>
             			<br>
            <p>3 / WILL I GET A DRIVER NOTHING FOR ME OR YOU SEND ME AN UBER?
              We risk not sending you a driver or an Uber but instead going to send you to ...
              
              4 / ON MY LAST SHOOTING, I FUCKED CONNARD.
              One: the cinema is a big family, two: you may have in front of you someone from the family of the one to whom you have settled your account, three: only say that if, obviously, you are the strongest of the cast.</p>
             <br>
             <font bold color=red><h2>Even more!?</h2></font>
             <br>
            <p>5 / IS IT PAID IN HOURS OR IN STAMPS?
              If you don't know that, come and do an internship with us, we will explain it to you.
              
              6 / ARE YOU NOT TIRED OF CASTING ALL THESE COTS?
              When it comes to idiots, watch out for the boomerang effect.
              
              7 / THAT REAL? I HATE HIM.
              Everyone hates him. Nobody says it. Now it's you we might hate.</p>
